### Separation of Concerns:
- The code follows the principle of separation of concerns by dividing the application into packages based on functionality (**model**, **service**, **dao**, **exception**, **test**).
- Each class has a specific responsibility, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

### Exception Handling:
- Exceptions are used to handle error scenarios gracefully. The **ParkingException** class is created for handling parking-related exceptions, providing a clear and consistent way to communicate errors.

### Asynchronous Processing:
- I used **CompletableFuture** to demonstrate asynchronous processing for parking and car removal operations. This improves responsiveness, especially in scenarios with multiple cars arriving or leaving simultaneously.
- The **calculateChargeAsync** method shows how asynchronous operations can be beneficial for time-consuming tasks like charge calculation.

### Persistence Layer:
- I introduced a simple **ParkingRecordDAO** interface and its implementation **ParkingRecordDAOImpl** to demonstrate persistent storage to a text file.
- Each car's entry and exit information is stored in a text file (**parking_records.txt**), providing a basic example of persistence.

### Unit Testing:
- I included a JUnit test class (**ParkingServiceTest**) to demonstrate testing of the **ParkingServiceImpl** class.
- The tests cover basic scenarios such as parking, attempting to park when the parking lot is full, and car removal.

### Mocking for Testing:
- I used a **MockParkingRecordDAO** class to provide a mock implementation of the DAO for testing purposes. This ensures that the tests focus on the service logic without affecting the actual persistent storage.

### Clean Code:
- The code adheres to clean code principles such as meaningful variable and method names, appropriate comments, and consistent formatting.
- Exception messages are informative, providing developers with useful insights into what went wrong.

### Dynamic Charge Calculation:
- The charge calculation is kept simple for demonstration purposes, but it can be easily extended or modified based on specific requirements.

### Initialization of Parking Spots:
- The parking spots are initialized in the constructor of **ParkingServiceImpl**. This ensures that the parking spots are ready for use as soon as the service is instantiated.

### Flexible Time Representation:
- The **LocalDateTime** class is used for representing time, which is flexible and allows for easy conversion and manipulation.

### Summary
It's essential to note that design decisions may vary based on specific requirements, and the provided code serves as a starting point. Depending on the real-world context, additional considerations like thread safety, scalability, and more robust persistence mechanisms might be necessary. The code can be further enhanced based on specific use cases and requirements.
